## Game Rules

 + **Movement**
Each player can move in any direction (up, down, left, right) on the game grid but cannot move through walls.
 + **Bombs**
Players can place one bomb at a time. Bombs explode after a short period, destroying blocks and eliminating players nearby.
Explosions extend in all directions.
 + **Power-ups**
Power-ups can be found by destroying certain blocks and provide advantages such as:
  - **Movement Speed:** Increases the player's movement speed.
  - **Explosion Immunity:** The player can stand within the explosion's radius without dying.  
**WARNING: Power-ups last for only 5 seconds.**
 + **Walls and Obstacles**
The game grid consists of solid walls and destructible blocks.  
Destructible blocks can be destroyed with bomb explosions, revealing power-ups, while solid walls cannot be destroyed.
 + **Player Elimination**
A player is eliminated if they are hit by an explosion or touched by an enemy.

## Game Modes
The game is designed for 1 or 2 players. You can select the game mode at the beginning by pressing 1 or 2, depending on the number of participants.  
To win, players must complete three levels, with the difficulty increasing progressively.
